# TNW
I have created a WordPress theme, based TNW Hard Fork: https://thenextweb.com/hardfork. You can find the actual theme here: TNW/wp-content/themes/hardfork.

# TOOLS & RESOURCES 
- MAMP (for local development environment)
- phpMyAdming (for creating a database)
- Bootstrap (for making it responsive)

# STEPS
- The first step I took, was to download the latest WordPress version onto my MacBook. Then I setup up WordPress and created a database. 
- The next thing I did was adding all the basic files for a WordPress theme (index.php etc). After that, I added Bootstrap.
