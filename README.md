# TNW
I have created a WordPress theme, based on TNW Hard Fork: https://thenextweb.com/hardfork. You can find the actual theme here: TNW/wp-content/themes/hardfork.

# TOOLS & RESOURCES
- MAMP (for local development environment)
- phpMyAdmin (for creating a database)
- Bootstrap (for making it responsive)
- Fakerpress plugin (for generating content for posts)

# FIRST STEPS
- The first step I took, was to download the latest WordPress version onto my MacBook. Then I setup up WordPress and created a database.
- The next thing I did was adding all the basic files for a WordPress theme (index.php etc). After that, I added Bootstrap.
- Then I went on to making it able to add post to the index, link to a single article page.

As you can see, I have used the actual navbar & footer. This saved me some time, since I did have to completely code that from scratch.
I am aware the logo is not loading, I don't have the right logo file that is supposed to go in the navbar. Please bare in mind that This
is my first time programming a WordPress theme. There are probably a lot of things that could improve, but I happy to learn all of at
during my time @ TNW!
